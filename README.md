# Custom Hooks Snippets for VS Code

This VS Code extension adds a set of handy React hooks as code snippets to your editor. It supports both JavaScript and TypeScript and loads snippets from external files.

## What It Does

- **Hooks Snippets**: Provides ready-to-use snippets for various React hooks.
- **Automatic Loading**: Loads snippets from files, including hooks that depend on others.
- **File Type Detection**: Chooses the right snippet based on whether you're using JavaScript or TypeScript.

## How to Use

1. Open a JavaScript or TypeScript file in VS Code.
2. Type the snippet prefix (e.g., `useFetch`).
3. Select the snippet from the suggestion list to insert it into your code.

## Available Snippets

Here are some of the snippets you can use:

- **useFetch**: A hook to fetch data from a URL.
- **useAsync**: A hook to handle asynchronous tasks.
